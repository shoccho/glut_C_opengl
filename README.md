# glut_C_opengl
Some of my codes or tasks for barely making it alive through Computer graphics course
Although the name suggests glut but there are some glfw examples as well ( 1 or 2 mmaybe )
most of the codes are very basic and very poorly written but enough to making it through 
computer graphics course.
most of these codes are tested with gcc, freeglut on linux systems.
